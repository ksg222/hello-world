# hello-world

I am student of Kookmin University in korea and I'm studying Computer Science. My English is terrible but I'll try to get better. During my highschool times, I learned language C, C++, C#, Java, Mysql, php, html etc... Now, as a college student, I'll try to learn more by doing github and blogging kind of stuff.
